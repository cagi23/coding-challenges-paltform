Specification: Coding Challenge Web Platform with XP System

1. Overview
This platform is designed for developers to participate in real-world coding challenges and earn Experience Points (XP) based on their performance. Unlike traditional algorithmic and puzzle-based challenges, our platform focuses on practical, framework-based problem-solving. Competitions are unique and expire after a set time period, ensuring fresh and relevant challenges.

2. Key Features

2.1 User Profiles & Experience Points (XP)

Each developer has a unique profile displaying their XP and level.

XP is earned through completing challenges, reviewing code, and participating in competitions.

Levels are assigned based on accumulated XP, representing skill progression.

2.2 Coding Challenges

Challenges are based on real-world scenarios and utilize modern frameworks and technologies.

Each challenge is configured with a specific XP reward, based on difficulty and scope.

Developers submit solutions and receive feedback from peers or automated evaluation.

2.3 Competitions

Competitions are time-limited and expire after a predefined duration.

Each competition has unique challenges that are not repeated.

Leaderboards display top performers based on XP earned in the competition.

2.4 XP Configuration System

XP values are assigned dynamically based on challenge difficulty, solution quality, and completion time.

Additional XP bonuses may be awarded for code reviews and knowledge sharing.

2.5 Developer Levels & Progression

Levels are categorized from beginner to expert based on XP thresholds.

Higher levels unlock exclusive challenges and competitions.

Users can showcase their level and achievements in their public profiles.

3. Technical Considerations

Frontend: Modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, or Angular).

Backend: Scalable API architecture using Node.js, Python, or Go.

Database: NoSQL or relational database for tracking user progress and challenge data.

Authentication: OAuth integration for seamless login (GitHub, Google, etc.).

Evaluation Engine: Automated and manual review mechanisms to assess submissions.

4. Future Enhancements

Integration with hiring platforms to connect top performers with recruiters.

Gamification features such as badges, streaks, and challenge multipliers.

Community-driven challenge creation for more diverse problem sets.

This platform aims to create a unique, skill-enhancing experience for developers, helping them grow through practical coding exercises while gaining recognition for their expertise.
